        TestEd 2020 is the first workshop entirely focusing on education in software testing&mdash;how to teach and learn software testing 
          and how to get more software testing into the classrooms. TestEd will bring together researchers and practitioners who teach 
          software testing to share and discuss their experiences and best advice on how to bring more and better software testing 
          education into the classrooms.
